## STL Containers

Implementation of stack, vector and map containers of the C++ standard template library in a C++98 manner.

>The namespace for all containers and additional classes is ft.

Stack has vector class as default underlying container, but it still be compatible with other containers, the STL ones included.

Vector implementation does not include <bool> specialization.

Map uses Red-Black tree.

### Additional classes/structures:
- iterators_traits
- reverse_iterator
- enable_if (implementation it in a C++98 manner).
- is_integral
- equal
- pair
- make_pair
